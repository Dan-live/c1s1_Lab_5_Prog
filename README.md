Requirements for the program
1. In each variant, regardless of its specific task, the structure 
(array element) must have the following mandatory fields with information about 
student: - surname; - first name; - patronymic; - grades in the disciplines 
"Programming, SDA, Mathematical Analysis, Linear Algebra. 
2. Each structure (array element), in addition to the required fields for all options 
fields, must also have fields that contain the necessary information about the 
the student according to the option, for example, date of birth, gender, address, group number, etc. 
group number, etc.
3. The initial data for the program should be prepared in a text file using a 
text editor, making sure to place all 
information about an individual student in one line of the text file. 
4. Logically separate parts of the algorithm (data input, problem solving, 
output of the result, etc.) should be written as separate functions. 
5. In the tests, the values of the information fields of the structures should be selected in such a way that 
all situations that may arise for a given algorithm were checked in the task execution algorithm 
arise for a given algorithm, that is, to demonstrate the full correctness 
and universality of the algorithm.
